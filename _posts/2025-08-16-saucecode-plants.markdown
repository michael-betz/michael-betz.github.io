I'm a big fan of homemade chili-sauces. This is a little photo-album showing the plants which grew the chilis for these sauces.

# 2023
A friend of mine from Romania gifted me a single Carolina Reaper chili. I extracted the seeds and managed to cultivate a plant from it.
This is plant #1.

This plant grew very slowly but steadily over the summer. There were a lot of flowers but most of them fell off and there were only 1 or 2 fruits unfortunately. I kept the plant in my living room over the winter and it survived into the next year.

From the few fruits I harvested, I again extracted the seeds and shared them with friends and family.

Plant #1 was doing amazingly well over the summer, sometimes indoors, sometimes on my window sill.

It gave me a harvest of > 10 very spicy fruits.

At the same time my mum spawned plant #2 in Germany.

These plants where extremely happy, grew quickly to their full size and delivered a harvest of almost half a kilo of Carolina Reapers that year.

Some of the chilis were cut open, dried and processed to powder for spicing up food.
Drying Carolina Reaper chilis turns the air spicy!

Some were turned into the first hot-sauces with great success. The rest was frozen, to be able to quickly churn up a fresh hot sauce when new ingredients or ideas arrive.

Plant #2 moved to the window sill in my office. It liked the location there and grew quite lush, however it quickly outgrew its pot, making it difficult to keep it supplied with enough water, especially over the weekends.

At some point a lice infestation turned my desk into a sticky mess. I decided to move it outside, hoping that it would survive the shock of suddenly being exposed to full sun, wind, thunderstorms and heat waves.

It lost half its leafs but grew new ones in 2 weeks and recovered into a very sturdy plant. Let's see if it will produce fruit this summer.
